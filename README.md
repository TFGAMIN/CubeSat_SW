# CubeSat_SW
This is the code to be implemented in a cubesat whose payload is a microwave energy transmission system.
There are 2 versions of the code. In the first, the code is shown along with functions that allow the setup of the components that make up the satellite's avionics.
In the second version, the set up functions have been replaced by functions that numerically simulate the reading values ​​of each component. In this way, the code can be executed and validation tests performed on the data-handling functions.
